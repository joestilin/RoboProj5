# RoboProj5
Project 5 of the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer NanoDegree.

A simulated turtlebot robot navigates to pickup and dropoff locations in a Gazebo world environment. A marker is 
displayed at the pickup location until the robot reaches it, and reappears when the robot subsequently reaches the
dropoff location.

The map used by the robot for navigation is generated with the ROS ```gmapping``` package, which uses graph slam to
simultaneously localize the robot and create an occupancy grid for the environment. This process can be achieved by
running the ```test_slam.sh``` script in ```/catkin_ws/src/scripts``` and navigating manually with the keyboard via
the ```keyboard_teleop``` node.

Localization is achieved using Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) - or a particle filter - with knowledge of
the map generated by SLAM in the previous step. The ```amcl_demo``` node subscribes to the ```map``` topic.

Path planning: the custom ```pick_objects``` node communicates with the ROS navigation stack. When a goal is sent, 
a ```SimpleActionClient``` uses Djikstra's Algorithm to find a path to the goal. The planner is subscribed to the
```map``` topic.

In order to carry out the task of navigating to pickup and dropoff locations, the ```pick_objects``` node publishes
to the "marker_position" topic when the a goal is sent to the navigation stack. 

## Dependencies

ROS: Install Robot Operating System (ROS) by following these instructions: http://wiki.ros.org/Installation
   * Follow the instructions for a Desktop-Full Install.

Gazebo: Follow the instructions for your environment at http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?cat=install

Ubuntu one line installation:
```bash
$ curl -sSL http://get.gazebosim.org | sh
```

## Installation

Step 1:
Clone the repository into your workspace
```bash
$ git clone https://www.github.com/joestilin/RoboProj5
```

Step 2:
Initialize a catkin workspace inside src
```bash
$ cd /RoboProj5/catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_init_workspace
```
Step 3:
Move up to the catkin workspace root, build the package, and source the environment
```bash
$ cd ..
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

## Usage

1. Make the script ```home_service.sh``` executable and run it
```bash
$ cd /RoboProj5/catkin_ws/src/scripts
$ chmod +x ./home_service.sh
$ ./home_service.sh
```
